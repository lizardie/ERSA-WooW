### Introduction

Contrary to what many people believe, there are very good alternatives to `Word` and `Powerpoint`. In the scientific world, though significantly less in the social sciences, the typesetting program `LaTeX` is often used. In many ways, including style, consistency, performance, and reproducability, `LaTeX` is far more superior than `Word`. The downside is that `LaTeX` has a far more steeper learning curve than `Word`. We therefore give two introductionary workshops for those students who are interested in using `LaTeX` (and some associated applications) and are willing to give it a try. 

Moreover, being able to work with `LaTeX` enables you to better understand why so many scientific applications nowadays center around using plain `.txt` files, such as `GitHub`, `R`, `Stata` do files, scriptfiles for `ArcGis`, `HTML`, blogs and data you can readily derive from websites such as `Twitter` and `Google`. 

Be warned however, deciding to use new tools are usually costly in terms of **time**. However, in the end it is hopefully very rewarding, if not for only getting these pesky references right. Moreover, understanding `LaTeX` syntax might as well be helpful because most formulas nowadays used on internet (especially on Wikipedia) are created by `LaTeX` commands.
